# React Hooks Examples

This repository shows how to use React Hooks in React Native. The examples are simple.

These are the hooks that included:

- useState
- useReducer
- useRef
- useEffect
- useLayoutEffect
- useImperativeHandle
- useContext
- useMemo
- useCallback

This examples are based on a YouTube video on [PedroTech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlvBzyy-558). The code is translated to React Native component since the examples in the video uses ReactJs.

Feel free to use it. Any suggestion or critics are welcome.
